''' Program: Tic-Tac-Toe with numbers. A board of 3 x 3 is displayed and player 1 takes odd numbers 1,
3, 5, 7, 9 and player 2 takes even numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. Players take turns to write their
numbers. Odd numbers start. Use each number only once. The first person to complete a line
that adds up to 15 is the winner. The line can have both odd and even numbers.'''
